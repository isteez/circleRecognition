circleRecognition
=================

A custom UIGestureRecognizer

Current gestures recognized:
  - circle
Feature gestures to be recognized:
  - arrow
  
The current implementation is using only one test to verify if the shape drawn is a circle or not.
If the start point of a shape is less than 60 pixels away from the end point, then the shape is a circle.
Obviously, this can be beaten in many ways.

Future versions will include additional tests to verify if the shape is a circle.
